# Sudoku7

Back in 2011, I found an open source Sudoku generator that can generate
any size of Sudoku, with any pattern for the subgrids.

I used the generator to make a handful of 7x7 Sudoku-like puzzles for
my blog.

Recently, I took an interest in this, and used the Java client to make
a seven-page, 42 puzzle Sudoku book.  The process was laborious: I used
the Java program to make a puzzle, then I had to put multiple screenshots
in an image for each page of the book using Gimp.  It took me about two
days to make a seven page book.

The purpose of this project is to make the entire process of making a
7x7 Sudoku puzzle easier.

# To play

Open up the file example.pdf.

This puzzle is a variant of Sudoku I like to call "Prosperity 7".  In
this Sudoku variant, the board is only 7x7, and only the numbers
from 1 to 7 are used.  Neither 8 nor 9 are ever placed on this
board.

The object of this puzzle is to place the numbers 1 through 7 in the
blank spaces such that:

* Each row only has one instance of each number between 1 and 7.  In
  other words, no number is duplicated in a given row.

* Each column only has one instance of each number between 1 and 7.  In
  other words, no number is duplicated in a given column.

* Each of the seven-square shapes bordered by thick lines have all
  of the numbers between 1 and 7 precisely once.  

The puzzles in example.pdf are sorted by difficulty, starting
with easier puzzles and moving up to hard puzzles.

# To generate PDF files

Have Python (either Python2 or Python3; the script is a polyglot) installed.  
Ideally, use a virtual environment.  Then:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
./genPdf.py puzzle.pdf puzzles/*.xml 
```

The first argument is the PDF file generated.

The subsequent arguments are files which are generated by the Java
program in the `Generator/` directory (to get one started, I have 
included a number of already generated puzzles in the `puzzles/`
directory).

# Generating more puzzles

To generate more puzzles, we need a Java interpreter.  Both Oracle
Java 8 and OpenJDK 1.8.0_191 (i.e. the OpenJDK included with CentOS 7)
work with the supplied jar file which generates the puzzles.

To run the puzzle generator, make sure to be in a GUI environment (X
windows, Windows 10, etc.) and run the following commands:

```
cd Generator/
./generatePuzzles.sh
```

This will run the Java generator in a mostly batch mode; we still need
to click on "no" when saving each file (fixing this bug is my next project).
