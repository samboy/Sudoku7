# Sudoku7

Back in 2011, I found an open source Sudoku generator that can generate
any size of Sudoku, with any pattern for the subgrids.

I used the generator to make a handful of 7x7 Sudoku-like puzzles for
my blog.

Recently, I took an interest in this, and used the Java client to make
a seven-page, 42 puzzle Sudoku book.  The process was laborious: I used
the Java program to make a puzzle, then I had to put multiple screenshots
in an image for each page of the book using Gimp.  It took me about two
days to make a seven page book.

The purpose of this project is to make the entire process of making a
7x7 Sudoku puzzle easier.
