# Sudoku7

Back in 2011, I found an open source Sudoku generator that can generate
any size of Sudoku, with any pattern for the subgrids.

I used the generator to make a handful of 7x7 Sudoku-like puzzles for
my blog.

Recently, I took an interest in this, and used the Java client to make
a seven-page, 42 puzzle Sudoku book.  The process was laborious: I used
the Java program to make a puzzle, then I had to put multiple screenshots
in an image for each page of the book using Gimp.  It took me about two
days to make a seven page book.

The purpose of this project is to make the entire process of making a
7x7 Sudoku puzzle easier.

# To play

Open up the file example.pdf.

This puzzle is a variant of Sudoku I like to call "Prosperity 7".  In
this Sudoku variant, the board is only 7x7, and only the numbers
from 1 to 7 are used.  Neither 8 nor 9 are ever placed on this
board.

The object of this puzzle is to place the numbers 1 through 7 in the
blank spaces such that:

* Each row only has one instance of each number between 1 and 7.  In
  other words, no number is duplicated in a given row.

* Each column only has one instance of each number between 1 and 7.  In
  other words, no number is duplicated in a given column.

* Each of the seven-square shapes bordered by thick lines have all
  of the numbers between 1 and 7 precisely once.  

# To generate PDF files

Have Python installed.  Ideally, use a virtual environment.  Then:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
./genPdf.py puzzle.pdf puzzles/*.xml 
```

The first argument is the PDF file generated.

The subsequent arguments are files which are generated by the Java
program in the `Generator/` directory (to get one started, I have 
included a number of already generated puzzles in the `puzzles/`
directory).

# Generating more puzzles

To generate more puzzles, we need a Java interpreter.  Both Oracle
Java 8 and OpenJDK 1.8.0_191 (i.e. the OpenJDK included with CentOS 7)
work with the supplied jar file which generates the puzzles.

To run the puzzle generator, make sure to be in a GUI environment (X
windows, Windows 10, etc.) and run the following commands:

```
cd Generator/
java -jar Sudoku-NPGeneratorV2_0_2.jar
```

In a GUI environment with Java installed, double clicking on the
`Sudoku-NPGeneratorV2_0_2.jar` file in the `Generator/` directory
should open up this generator.

At this point a GUI window will open with the Sudoku generator.
Do the following to generate a puzzle:

* Select File -> Open File
* Open the file `Prosperity-7-template.xml`
* Click on the button `Set` near the bottom of the window
* Click on the button `Generate`
* Click on the button `Play`
* Select File -> Save file
* Choose a unique filename for the file
* Click on `Save`

To the right of the button `Answer`, it shows how hard the puzzle is
(the more "points" a puzzle has, the harder it is to solve)

It's possible to change where we put number hints (one can observe a number
of different patterns for hints in the example.pdf file supplied here).  
After opening up the `Prosperity-7-template.xml` file, click on `Set`
then right click to add or remove blue squares (squares were we put
number clues in a puzzle).

Note that in order to print, the puzzle `.xml` files need to be 7x7 files
using the same block arrangement (same set of heptominos used the generate
the 7x7 square).  The PDF generator can handle different location for the
number hints; it can *not* handle a different arrangement of sub-blocks
nor a different puzzle size (the PDF generator will not print incompatible 
files).

Converting the Java program in to one which can run in batch mode is
currently an exercise for the reader.
